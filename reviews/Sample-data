## ðŸ“„ About This Sample Dataset

This folder contains **20 sample files** that are part of a larger dataset originally sized at approximately **5 GB**.

### ðŸ”¹ Why is the data split?
Due to GitHubâ€™s file size and storage limitations, the original file has been **split into 100 smaller parts**, each approximately **50 MB** in size. These parts were created to make the data manageable and accessible for analysis, storage, and processing.

### ðŸ”¹ What does this folder contain?
- **20 out of the 100 total parts** are included here as a representative **sample**.
- These files are named sequentially (e.g., `yelp_part_01.json`, `yelp_part_02.json`, ..., `yelp_part_20.json`).
- Each file maintains the original structure and schema of the complete dataset.

### ðŸ”¹ How to use the full dataset?
If you're interested in working with the entire dataset:
- You can request access or reconstruct the full dataset by combining all 100 parts (not all are hosted here).
- The sample here is sufficient to run smaller-scale tests, build pipeline demos, or validate schema and structure.
